## VideoPoker User Instructions
### Launcher Screen
From this screen you make configurations for the game you would like to play. Two fields expect user input - "Credits" and "Credit Value". The number of credits you enter will be your purse to gamble with, betting one credit to a maximum of five. The game ends when you are out of credits. The "Credit Worth" field represents the monetary value of each credit. This has no functional purpose other than a representation of how much you would win or lose in a real game of video poker. Entering a value of zero for either of these will not allow you to play a hand. Click "Play!" and you will be prompted to select a game. 

### Game Screen
Once a game has been selected and your credits have been assigned you will be ready to bet and play. If you are unfamiliar with video poker, you can get information on how to play from the HELP button, although it is assumed you have a basic understanding of the rules of standard poker hands. From the options menu in the upper right corner of the screen you can select to view the paytable for a game you have selected. Also from this menu you can select to view credits in the currency worth you declared. This choice is stored as a shared user preference. Hand analysis and autoplay is not yet implemented. Select the MAIN button to return to the launcher screen and select different game options. If you change your mind, you can return to the game you're currently playing by using the Back button from the launcher screen but once you have begun a new game the previous game will be lost. Pressing the Back button from the Game screen will end the application.
