## Aims
*Your aims or motivations for selecting the given topic for your app. That is, why did you choose to develop this particular app, and why is this (at least potentially) a useful or interesting app?* <br />

## Current State
*A description of the current state of completion/readiness of your app. This should include a “hit list” of deficiencies: any unimplemented/incomplete elements, and known bugs, that would have to be implemented or corrected for a usable prototype (i.e. one that could be given to a skilled user for testing and feedback), ordered with the most urgent items first.*

## Versions
*A list of Android API versions and hardware (including emulators) on which you’ve tested the submitted version of your app, the minimum Android API required, and any other hardware/software/orientation restrictions that you’re aware of.

## Cosmetic stretch goals
*A list of aesthetic/cosmetic (not functional) improvements that you think would improve your app. This list should be ordered, with those that would give the most improvement (in your opinion) listed first.*

## Functional stretch goals
*A list of functional stretch goals. These should be sorted either with those that would add the most utility at the top, or with those that would be the simplest to implement at the top.*
